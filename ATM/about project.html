            <!--project description-->
            <h2>Project Descriprion</h2>
            <p>What we designed is an mobile app that sells sneakers.What we do in this application is a B to C e-commerce platform.In  this age of national fashion, it's not just teenagers who buy good-looking fashion items. The emergence of limited edition sneakers has caused a stir in the market.The limited size and beauty of the shoe is the value of the shoe on the market.Rather than designing an app for selling sneakers, we provide a safe and assured identification platform for buyers and sellers.What we're doing here is putting together some of the hottest sneakers of the moment.As sellers, they can bid on the platform, and the sellers can clearly see the money they will get after the platform deducts the equivalent fee.But the earnest money that the seller bid needs to make equal amount, earnest money's effect is once the seller delivers goods not in time or the circumstance that appears in appraisal link false undertakes deducting. The advantage of doing so is to reduce the cost of purchasing decision by users, but it improves the trust cost of users and reduces the efficiency of after-sales service, so more after-sales service personnel need to be added. The platform will display all sellers with the lowest price.As consumers, they can clearly see the different prices of different sizes of sneakers they want.As a middleman, the seller needs to deliver the sneakers to the platform within a certain period of time after the customer places an order. The platform will have a professional team to identify and package the sneakers and send them to the buyer.A customer can also make a bid. The customer can make a bid for the size of the shoe they want. The platform will display the highest bid, and a match can be made if a seller is willing to accept the price. We also provide sales records and prices for each item for everyone to compare. We will also provide a virtual fitting for each pair of shoes, leveraging Augmented Reality technology. When the user turns on the phone's camera to point at the foot, the AR function will automatically identify the foot and realize the purpose of virtual fitting. </p>
