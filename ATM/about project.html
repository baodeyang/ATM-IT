            <p>ATM Sneakers App</p>

            <!--project description-->
            <h2>Project Descriprion</h2>
            <p>What we designed is an mobile app that sells sneakers.What we do in this application is a B to C e-commerce platform.In  this age of national fashion, it's not just teenagers who buy good-looking fashion items. The emergence of limited edition sneakers has caused a stir in the market.The limited size and beauty of the shoe is the value of the shoe on the market.Rather than designing an app for selling sneakers, we provide a safe and assured identification platform for buyers and sellers.What we're doing here is putting together some of the hottest sneakers of the moment.As sellers, they can bid on the platform, and the sellers can clearly see the money they will get after the platform deducts the equivalent fee.But the earnest money that the seller bid needs to make equal amount, earnest money's effect is once the seller delivers goods not in time or the circumstance that appears in appraisal link false undertakes deducting. The advantage of doing so is to reduce the cost of purchasing decision by users, but it improves the trust cost of users and reduces the efficiency of after-sales service, so more after-sales service personnel need to be added. The platform will display all sellers with the lowest price.As consumers, they can clearly see the different prices of different sizes of sneakers they want.As a middleman, the seller needs to deliver the sneakers to the platform within a certain period of time after the customer places an order. The platform will have a professional team to identify and package the sneakers and send them to the buyer.A customer can also make a bid. The customer can make a bid for the size of the shoe they want. The platform will display the highest bid, and a match can be made if a seller is willing to accept the price. We also provide sales records and prices for each item for everyone to compare. We will also provide a virtual fitting for each pair of shoes, leveraging Augmented Reality technology. When the user turns on the phone's camera to point at the foot, the AR function will automatically identify the foot and realize the purpose of virtual fitting. </p>

            <!--Project Justification-->
            <h2>Project Justification</h2>
                <h3>Workload</h3>
                <p>The pre-arrangement of our group is that each person will work one hour a day, and each person will work a total of five hours a week. In the process of doing homework, we made appropriate adjustments. Everyone worked five hours a week, and a meeting was held on Sunday to discuss the problems encountered during homework. And we divided the work within the group. The two were a group, and the assignment was divided into three parts: the web part and two documents. Each group chooses a main part and assists other groups. Each part should be completed by August 9th, and the last meeting will be held on August 9th, integrating the three parts, and in the last week, make the final revision and submit. </p>
                <h3>Beyond Current Capabilities</h3>
                <p>Each of us is good at writing documents. For coding, everyone has different skills. Some people are good at css, some are good at html, and some are good at java. In our group, we are divided into three groups, two people make a group, each of the two people in the group is good at different skills, some people are good at writing code, some people are good at writing documents, people who are good at writing code , Will mainly do code work, and those who are good at writing documents will assist those who write code and do some code work, and those who are good at writing code will also do some documents work, so that everyone will get out of their comfort zone , And learn different skills from other team members to improve their IT skills. </p>
                
                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>Risk: AWS is not good at using 
                    <br>Example: Everyone in our group is using AWS for the first time and is better at using GitHub. 
                    <br>Mitigation: We discussed this issue with the teacher, and the teacher sent us a usage report, which helped us a lot. Everyone in the group teaches the others what he know. 
                </p>
                <p>Risk: Different opinions
                    <br>Example: At the beginning of the assignment, everyone has a different idea of the procedure. 
                    <br>Mitigation: We have elected a team leader who will remove bad ideas and integrate good ideas. Because sometimes ideas that we can't complete are presented, the project will be difficult to proceed without the team leader. 
                </p>
                <p>Risk: The project is very difficult 
                    <br>Example: This project involves many aspects and is very difficult.
                    <br>Mitigation: The realization of this project will involve many different fields. For the first part of the homework, we can also solve it. When the project is in the later stage, it is difficult for our existing knowledge to meet our goals, so in our spare time, they are all trying to supplement their knowledge to ensure the successful completion of the project.
